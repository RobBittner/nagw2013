NAGW 2013 Git Presentation

This sample project was created as part of my presentation on using Git and Github at the 2013 NAGW Conference. It was made as a playground for those trying to learn Git or wanting to test it on a sample project.

Please clone this project and follow the instructions in the code. Feel free to edit, add, delete as you see fit. Don't be afraid of trying out commands and making mistakes. Everything can be rolled back; after all that's the point of using version control!

You can also issue a pull request back to this project once you've made edits if you'd like to test out how that functionality works.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact me.
